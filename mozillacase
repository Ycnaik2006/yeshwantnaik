• Understanding Development Models:
Mozilla utilizes an open-source development model for its flagship product, the Mozilla Firefox web browser. This model encourages contributions from a global community of developers, testers, and volunteers. This collaborative approach allows for rapid updates and innovation, with the community actively involved in fixing bugs, enhancing features, and ensuring security.

• Licensing:
Mozilla Firefox is released under the Mozilla Public License (MPL), which is an open-source license. This license grants users the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software, promoting transparency and openness in the development process. It also imposes certain responsibilities on those who modify and distribute the code, ensuring the continued availability of open-source software.

• Mode of Funding:
Mozilla's primary source of funding historically came from partnerships with search engines, such as Google, which paid Mozilla for making their search engines the default in Firefox. However, they have diversified their revenue streams by exploring other partnerships, donations, and initiatives like the Mozilla Foundation. These funds are crucial for Mozilla's continued development and support for open-source projects.

• Commercial/Non-Commercial Aspects:
Mozilla operates as a hybrid organization with both commercial and non-commercial aspects. While Mozilla Corporation, a subsidiary, manages commercial activities like partnerships and product development, the Mozilla Foundation focuses on non-commercial initiatives, including internet health advocacy, education, and supporting open-source projects. This dual approach allows Mozilla to balance its financial sustainability with its mission of ensuring the internet remains open and accessible.
